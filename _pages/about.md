# About me

Hi! This is Fang Wan, a first year PhD student in Computer Science at Stony Brook University supervised by [Professor Yi Liu](https://jacoblau0513.github.io/). 

Currently, my research interests are in generative models, especially the potential combination with AI for science. I am also interested in other computer science topics such as machine learning theory and optimization.
