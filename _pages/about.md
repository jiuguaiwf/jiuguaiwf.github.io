# About me

Hi! This is Fang Wan, a first year PhD student in Computer Science at Stony Brook University supervised by [Professor Yi Liu](https://jacoblau0513.github.io/). 

Currently, my research interest is GenAI.

* **Explicit Likelihood Models** (Diffusion Models and Flow Models)
  * Correcting and accelerating inference trajectories, and designing better architectures for generative performance.  
  * Modeling complex data distributions and generalizing the generative procedure to manifolds beyond the Euclidean case.  
  * Combining with scientific discovery, including applications to molecules, conformers, and proteins.  

* **Implicit Likelihood Models** (Language Models)
  * Transformer architectures and large-scale foundation models for scientific discovery (e.g., LLM4Science).
