I am a first-year PhD student at UC San Diego department of CSE, advised by [Professor Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/). My current research interest lies in physics-informed machine learning and geometric deep learning. I am particularly excited about machine learning methods for scientific discovery, such as symmetry discovery and governing equation discovery.
