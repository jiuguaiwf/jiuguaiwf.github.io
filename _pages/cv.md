A Little More About Me
======
I am a first-generation immigrant. My family and I moved to the United States, like many others, in pursuit of a better life—the American dream. When we first arrived, I barely spoke English. College wasn’t my favorite place at first—in fact, I hated school. I worked in restaurants, food stands, and did food deliveries. After a year of hard labor, I decided to continue my education—probably because my parents wanted me to as well. I started at a community college, not even in an associate degree program, but in an immersion program to learn English. Later, I transferred to Stony Brook University. I didn’t even learn Calculus 2 until my sophomore year. Now, I am a Ph.D. student in applied mathematics and have first-authored several papers in top-tier journals and conferences. I’m grateful to everyone who supported me along the way. While I’m still on my journey to success, I hope my story can motivate others who are struggling. It’s never too late to start something.
