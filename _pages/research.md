Current Research Interests
======
* Up to date information about my research can be found on [My Research Homepage](https://zbz3th212a4.larksuite.com/wiki/KepHwqohli4xq3kehQFu50pRseh)
* Neural Operators (Learning in infinite-dimensional function spaces, as opposed to traditional neural networks that learn vector-to-vector mappings); [Short Intro](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Neural_operators.pdf)
* Equivariant Networks (Embedding symmetries into neural networks); [Short Intro 1](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Equivariant_network1.pdf) ;[Short Intro 2](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Equivariant_network2.pdf)


Past Research: Physics Informed Neural Networks
======
* Participated in the NSF funded REU program “Mathematical, Statistical and Computational Methods for Problems inthe Life Sciences”.
* Designed Active Learning based Sampling to adaptively sample training examples to faster the convergence.
* Designed Self-normalized algorithm to simulate draws from unnormalized distributions.
* Compatible with 3 recent DL based PDE solvers:  Deep Rits Method, Deep Galerkin Method, Weak Adversarial Networks
