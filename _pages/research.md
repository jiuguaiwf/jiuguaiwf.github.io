Current Research Interests
======
* Neural Operators (Learning in infinite-dimensional function spaces, as opposed to traditional neural networks that learn vector-to-vector mappings); [Short Intro](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Neural_operators.pdf)
* Equivariant Networks (Embedding symmetries into neural networks); [Short Intro 1](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Equivariant_network1.pdf) ;[Short Intro 2](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/Equivariant_network2.pdf)
* Generative Models (Learning the underlying data distribution and generate new, realistic samples that resemble the original data); [Intro and VAE](https://wenhangao21.github.io/files/VAE_10192024.pdf)
* Physics Informed Neural Networks (Solving PDEs by penalizing the extent to which the network solution violates the PDE); [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999122009111)
